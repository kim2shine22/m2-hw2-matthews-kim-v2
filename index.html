            <h2>Why Create Planned Chaos?</h2>
            <article>
            <p>Planned chaos gardening is perfect for control freaks who are into barely tamable, luxurious yard jungles. By mixing biointensive and French gardening techniques, my gardens become places of compatibility and diversity, where you’ll catch vegetables fraternizing with flowers in broad daylight. The fun is learning all the rules so I can bend them: tucking pop‑up veggies into flower drifts, sneaking nectar plants into the tomatoes, and watching the whole thing knit itself into thick groundcover that blocks out the sunlight most weeds need to grow. Letting plants grow a little wild—more like they would in nature—has increased my garden’s production substantially.</p>

            <h2>Planned Chaos vs TradGardeners</h2>
            <article>
            <p>Planned chaos gardeners and tradgardeners both plan, but we’re cramming for a different exam. Tradgardeners can memorize one neat rotation chart and rinse, rotate and repeat for the next year; I’m out here cross referencing sun exposure, bloom times, root depths, pollinator preferences, full moons, and which brassica will throw a tantrum next to which allium. They get to stop planning once the rows are straight; I’m still scheming how to tuck in a surprise squash without starting a nutrient war. The joke is me as tmy garden looks wild and theirs looks proper, but I had to study twice as hard to earn the right to let mine misbehave in pure, magical chaos.</p>

            <h2>The Amazing Results of Chaos</h2>
            <article>
            <p>Planned chaos is my favorite experiment in garden misbehavior. One season of intentional disorder reliably produces top tier scholarly evidence: jars of dissertation level pickles and harvests that would make a seed catalog blush. The data set is simple: more diversity, tighter spacing, fewer weeds, and a frankly indecent number of tomatoes. In other words, the results strongly support the hypothesis that a little well researched chaos is very good for both the soil and the soul. That’s right… I earned my PhD in chaos. </p>

            <p>Here are a few guiding rules I use when planning a chaos bed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Purchase "How to Grow More Vegetables" from the link below.</li>
                    <li>Use this amazing resource to plot our your own version of chaos.</li>
                    <li>Remember that the book is just a guide, your garden can be any size, shape, or mix that you want... it can also be planted directly in the ground.</li>
                    <li>Now, go and plant it like Mother Nature intended!</li>
                </ul>
                </article>
            <p>For a deeper dive into intensive planting methods, I highly recommend this overview of biointensive gardening:
